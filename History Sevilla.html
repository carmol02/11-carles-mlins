                <h2>History Sevilla</h2>
                <p>The practice of soccer was introduced in Seville at the end of the 19th century by the large British
                    colony established in the city, made up of owners, managers and employees of manufacturing companies
                    located there.
                    In 1890, taking advantage of the Scottish tradition of Burns Night, which is celebrated every
                    January 25, a group of British and Spanish decided to found a football club (FC), that is, a club
                    that would play according to the rules. of the Football Association (not those of football rugby).
                    At the same time, that same night two other important decisions were made: firstly, that the club
                    should bear the name of the city where its founders were based (Seville), and secondly, to agree on
                    and choose the main positions of the entity ( president, secretary and captain).
                    The first president of Sevilla Football Club was Edward Farquharson Johnston,15 British vice-consul
                    in the city; The first secretary was Isaías White Méndez,16 from Seville based at 41 Bailén street
                    (first social and administrative headquarters of the club) and the first captain was Hugo MacColl,17
                    a Scottish naval engineer,18 who in addition to Carrying out the duties of a captain, he provided
                    the Sevilla Football Club with balls and shirts in its beginnings, through the MacAndrews shipping
                    company.
                </p>


                <p>The decade after the Civil War would be one of the most fruitful for Sevilla: one league, one league
                    runner-up and two cups.
                    After the end of the war, Sevilla won the first Copa del Generalísimo (their second Spanish Cup),
                    which they still own. The League also resumed and in the 1939/40 season it achieved resounding
                    victories: against F. C. Barcelona 11-1, against Valencia C. F. 10-3 or against Hércules C. F. 8-3.
                    However, the title escaped him in the last game, in a draw with Hercules. Its forward, "the stukas"
                    (named after the devastating German planes), scored 216 goals in four seasons. They formed it were:
                    López, Torrontegui, Campanal, Raimundo, Berrocal and Pepillo.30 39
                    In 1941 Ramón Sánchez-Pizjuán left the club's presidency to become a director of the Spanish
                    Football Federation. That year, the decree of February 22, which created the National Sports
                    Delegation, placed Spanish sports under the control of the Movement, limiting the social functions
                    of football clubs.
                    The National Delegation, chaired by José Moscardó, appointed the directors of the regional
                    federations and these in turn appointed the presidents of the clubs, who had to identify politically
                    with the Franco regime. After the departure of Sánchez-Pizjuán, Antonio Sánchez Ramos held the
                    presidency on an interim basis until the appointment of Jerónimo Domínguez y Pérez de Vargas
                    (Marqués de Contadero), who spent six years in the presidency of the club, until the return of
                    Sánchez-Pizjuán .40​
                    Sevilla obtained the best league results in its history between 1942 and 1946. It was runner-up in
                    the 1942/43 season and third in the following. In the 1945/46 season they won their first and only
                    League to date.41 The team was coached by Ramón Encinas and the ideal eleven of that season was made
                    up of José María Busto, Joaquín Jiménez, Diego Villalonga, Pedro Alconero, Francisco Antúnez, Pedro
                    Eguiluz, José López Martínez, Juan Arza, Juan Araujo, José Palacios Herrera and José Campos
                    Rodríguez.
                    In 1948 Sevilla was proclaimed Cup champion for the third time in its history.
                    The most significant signing of those years was striker Juan Arza, who, along with Alconero, was
                    international several times. There was also the debut of Campanal's nephew, defender Campanal II,
                    with his uncle as coach.

                </p>


                <p>The 2005/06 season would begin with a new coach, Juande Ramos, and would be marked by the
                    celebrations associated with the club's centenary and, in sports, by the achievement of a European
                    title for the first time by winning the UEFA Cup in the final played in the Dutch city of Eindhoven.
                    61 In the semifinals of this tournament Antonio Puerta scored a memorable goal that facilitated the
                    pass to the final. The champion team of the season was made up of Palop, David, Pablo Alfaro, Javi
                    Navarro, Escudé/Dragutinovic, Dani Alves, Martí, Maresca, Adriano, Kanouté, Jesús Navas and
                    Saviola/Luis Fabiano.62
                    Juande Ramos.

                    2006/07 was arguably the most successful season in its history, beginning by winning the European
                    Super Cup by beating Fútbol Club Barcelona 3-0 at the Luis II Stadium in Monaco.63 Later they won
                    their second consecutive UEFA Cup in a final played in Glasgow against Real Club Deportivo Español.
                    64 The match had extra time and the title was decided in a penalty shootout, with goalkeeper Andrés
                    Palop being the hero by stopping three shots (who also in one of the previous qualifiers had
                    decisive by scoring a headed goal from a corner, thus facilitating the extra time of the match and
                    the subsequent victory of his team). Sevilla also managed to win the Copa del Rey and finished 3rd
                    in the League, with a record score for the date and the right to participate in the Champions League
                    the following year. As a result of these successes, the club received the Best Team in the World
                    trophy awarded by the IFFHS.65 The ideal eleven this season was made up of Palop, Dani Alves, Javi
                    Navarro, Escudé/Dragutinovic, Puerta, Jesús Navas, Poulsen, Renato , Adriano, Kanouté and Luis
                    Fabiano, being coach Juande Ramos.62


                </p>


                <p>The 2007/08 season opened with a fifth title, the Spanish Super Cup66 won against Real Madrid, but it
                    was marked by extra-sporting vicissitudes that diminished the team's performance. First of all, the
                    sudden death of the player Antonio Puerta, who in the first league game on August 25 had to retire
                    after momentarily losing consciousness and died three days later.
