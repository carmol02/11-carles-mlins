                <h2>Hymns</h2>
                <p>Sevilla F.C. has two official anthems:

                    Official anthem of Sevilla F. C. This anthem dates from 1983. The lyrics were written by Ángel Luis
                    Osquiguilea de Roncales and the music was composed by Manuel Osquiguilea de Roncales.

                    Hymn of the centenary of Sevilla F.C. Composed in 2005 by the singer Javier Labandón El Arrebato on
                    the occasion of the celebration of the 100 years of the entity. The centenary hymn became number one
                    in sales in Spain in the singles category and managed to be the best-selling football club hymn in
                    the entire history of Spanish football, reaching 2nd place among the best-selling albums in 2006.
                    On October 9, 2006, he was awarded the gold record for the Centennial Anthem at the Ramón
                    Sánchez-Pizjuán stadium.

                    The club also owns, unofficially, an anthem called "Aupa Sevilla!", composed in 1971 by Pedro Gámez
                    Laserna and with lyrics by Manuel López Jiménez, thus being the oldest Sevilla anthem ever created.
                </p>

                <h2>Shield</h2>
                <p>Heraldically, the Sevilla Fútbol Club shield is defined as follows:

                    Swiss shield, half split and cut. First, made of silver, the patron saints, seated, in the manner of
                    the city's shield. Second, silver, the intertwined letters “S”, “F” and “C” of saber. Third, of
                    silver, five sticks of gules. Angrelated general comble of two pieces of gules, one for each
                    barracks. In the abyss, above all, an old natural soccer ball.
                    So, the main features are:

                    The Swiss way. In 1921, Pablo Rodríguez Blanco designed a new shield for the club. In his creation
                    process, he sketched two designs: One in the shape of the Swiss shield, and another in the shape of
                    the Polish shield, which had already been adopted by teams such as the Foot-Ball Club Barcelona.
                    Finally he opted for the Swiss, for being more stylized.

                    The three saints The three figures that appear in the first quarter are, from left to right, San
                    Isidoro, San Fernando and San Leandro. Its appearance is directly related to the coat of arms of
                    Seville, where the three saints have appeared since 1311.

                    The initials. In the second quarter the initials of the club are intertwined. An "s" in reference to
                    Sevilla, an "f" in reference to football, and a "c" in reference to the club, the name the club
                    coined when it was founded: Sevilla Foot-ball Club. It has been maintained until the present day due
                    to the coincidence with the subsequent Spanishization of the term "Foot-Ball" to "Fútbol".

                    The red and white bars. In the third quarter, there are six red bars and five white bars. There are
                    several explanatory hypotheses for them, such as that the designer's desire was for the team to
                    adopt the red and white shirt as official clothing or to use those colors in imitation of the famous
                    England soccer teams at that time. Another version indicates that they are inspired by the banner
                    carried by Fernando III the Saint in the conquest of Seville in 1248.

                    The ball. In the center of the shield appears the official ball of the 1938 World Cup in France, the
                    Allen model. In the original 1921 design, however, a ball from the late 10s or early 20s with 6 or 8
                    seams appears.

                    The gold border. The shield is bordered in a yellow-gold color.

                    Since its foundation, the team used different stamps, which were the first signs of the club's
                    corporatism. The most used seal was a shield of two concentric circles; Between both circles was
                    written the name of the club and the date of the approval of its statutes: «SEVILLA FOOT-BALL CLUB
                    1905». The inner circle, on a white background, had the letters SFC drawn intertwined with each
                    other as they appear on the current shield.

                    From the first graphic tests, in 1908, until 1921, the players had the club's shield designed by
                    Juan Lafita, a person closely linked to the entity and the son of the Sevillian painter José Lafita
                    y Blanco, on the shirts at the height of their hearts. The shield, included in the club's statutes,
                    consists of a circle in gules, and inside the initial letters of the club's name (ese, efe and ce)
                    linked and in gules. In 1921, Pablo Rodríguez Blanco, a draftsman for the Water Company, designed a
                    new shield for the Sevilla Fútbol Club, which was well received within the board of directors and
                    debuted on October 16, 1921 in a match against the Portuguese club Casa Pia Atlético Clube.77 This
                    shield, with slight design variations, such as the modification of the color of the initials from
                    red to black devised by Santiago del Campo in 1982, is the one that has been maintained to this day.

                <h2>Flag</h2>
                <p>The definition of the Sevilla Football Club flag is contained in the statutes in force in 2015, which
                    were a modification of the old ones and which were deposited in the Register of Sports Associations
                    and Federations, of the Higher Sports Council. Its Title 6, Article 38, says that, among others, the
                    following are hallmarks of Sevilla F.C.: The flag will be an area of ​​2:3 proportions cut in half
                    at the bottom, white at the pole and red at the flap. Thus, it will carry the club's shield in its
                    center, its height being two fifths of its width. Previously, the club has used various identifying
                    flags. There is evidence that since 1913 there were already distinctive club flags, such as a red
                    flag with two white blades crossing them,78 or a flag with a horizontal stripe in the middle
                    dividing the white and red colors,78 these two colors being interchangeable up or down. We found our
                    first flag created for this purpose in 1913, with the inauguration of the Mercantil field.79 This,
                    presumably designed by Juan Lafita, was cut in half at the bottom, white on the pole and three red
                    and two white on the beat. On the pole, the club's official shield at the time. This flag has
                    recently been rediscovered by the club, and it appears in the anteroom of the Ramón Sánchez-Pizjuán
                    stadium together with the official flag and the club's centenary flag. During the centenary events,
                    a flag was designed to celebrate said event. Said flag, known simply as the "Centenary flag" , was
                    presented on July 1, 2005 80 and was immediately successful among Sevilla fans, displayed in the
                    Olympic roundabout in Seville throughout the year. This flag has a red background, and in white, in
                    the center, you can read the word "one hundred" , glimpsing in the "n" an outline of the shape of
                    the club's shield.</p>
