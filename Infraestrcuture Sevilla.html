                <h2>Stadium</h2>
                <p>Sevilla F.C. plays its matches at the Ramón Sánchez-Pizjuán Stadium, but in the first sixty-eight
                    years of the club's existence, it played its matches in fields located in different areas of the
                    city. The club has played its home games on a regular basis.</p>


                <p> Projects began for the Ramón Sánchez-Pizjuán stadium in 1937, when the land on which he planned to
                    build the New Nervión Stadium was purchased, but it was not until 1954 when the first steps were
                    taken to build it, at which time a design competition won by the architect Manuel Muñoz Monasterio,
                    who had been a partner in the construction of the Santiago Bernabéu Stadium. Its coordinates are
                    37°23′01″N 5°58′17″W.

                    The stadium was originally going to be called "Grand Stadium", but when Ramón Sánchez-Pizjuán died
                    suddenly in 1956, who was president of the club at the time of his death, a member requested by
                    written letter that the new stadium carry his name, request that was accepted. The construction of
                    the stadium finished in the summer of 1958 and it was inaugurated on September 7 of the same year,
                    with a friendly match that Sevilla played against Real Jaén. However, the field still did not have
                    the high stands of Fondo and Preferencia. In 1974, under the presidency of Eugenio Montes Cabeza, it
                    was finally closed, reaching its highest capacity at that time, with more than 70,000 spectators.

                    On the occasion of the 1982 World Cup, the visor, the preferred mosaic and new lighting were built.
                    In addition, the field's capacity was reduced, leaving around 66,000 spectators. The last
                    modification was in the mid-nineties, when complying with FIFA regulations, it was necessary to
                    eliminate all the areas where football could be watched standing up, the capacity of the stadium
                    became 45,500 people. With the reforms of the 2015-2016 season, the total capacity was reduced to
                    43,883 people.

                    Currently, with the major reforms started, it has a capacity for 47.07482 spectators. </p>


                <p>It has several trophies and titles to its credit that make it the team with the most regional,
                    national and international titles in Seville and throughout Andalusia.
                </p>


                <p>During the 1982 World Cup, the group stage matches between the USSR and Brazil were held there, as
                    well as the semifinals between West Germany and France.83 Later a Cup final was also played of
                    Europe in 1986, between Steaua Bucharest and F. C. Barcelona.84 It has been one of the usual venues
                    for the Spanish soccer team, which has won 19 of the 22 games played in it, drawing the remaining 3
                    and not having never suffered defeat.

                    In 1982, on the occasion of the World Soccer Championship, a mosaic was built on the main façade,
                    the work of Santiago del Campo. On the occasion of the centenary in 2005, an allegorical mosaic
                    designed by Ben Yessef was built in the South Goal that shows the city of Seville and, above it,
                    floating in the wind, the club's shield.2585

                    In September 2019 it was chosen to host the 2021 Europa League final86

                    Currently the club's media headquarters houses a shop for club-related items, a museum and a trophy
                    room.</p>
